This script concats all mp4 video files in a specified folder to a mp4 file called "output.mp4" using *ffmpeg*. I use this script to concat video slices from my dash camera installed on my car.

**Usage:**

```
chmod +x concat.sh
./concat.sh [path_with_mp4_files]
```

**Warning:**

Path that contains whitespace or other funky characters will NOT WORK and might damage your data.

*I accidentally removed a precious video file when writing this script.*
